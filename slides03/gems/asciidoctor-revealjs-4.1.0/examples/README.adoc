= Examples

Minimal AsciiDoc slide-decks to showcase reveal.js' features or test for regressions.

They are also used in automated testing.
Because of that some metadata (AsciiDoc comments `//`) is present.

== Preview examples (ruby)

    $ bundle exec rake examples:convert

== Preview examples (javascript)

    $ bundle exec rake build:converter:opal
    $ npm run examples

Make sure you have a link between `examples/node_modules/` and `node_modules/` where reveal.js is installed.
